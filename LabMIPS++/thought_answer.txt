For example, if derived class defined some more member variables than base class and we constructed an instance of base class using
the constructor of derived class. Then the new variables defined in derived class would still be allocated but the base destructor won't
delete them automatically as it doesn't know the existence of these variables. Thus, we need to virtual destructor to prevent memory leak.
